## Sprint Test Plan (1-Page)

```markdown
# Sprint [N] Test Plan
**Sprint dates:** [start] - [end]
**Features in scope:** [list with ticket IDs]
**Test lead:** [name]
**Last updated:** [date]

## Scope
| Feature | Risk | Test Types | Owner | Status |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| [name]  | HIGH | E2E, Unit, Exploratory | [name] | Not Started |
| [name]  | MED  | Unit, Manual | [name] | In Progress |

## Coverage Summary
- Requirements mapped: __ / __ (target: 100%)
- Automated coverage: __ / __ test cases
- Manual coverage: __ / __ test cases
- Gaps identified: __ (with justification)

## Effort Budget
- Total available: __ hours
- Allocated: __ hours (target: 70-80% utilization)
- Buffer: __ hours (20-30%)

## Environment & Data
- Staging URL: [url]
- Test accounts: [location/reference]
- Test data setup: [script/manual steps]

## Entry Criteria
- [ ] Features code-complete and deployed to staging
- [ ] Test data seeded
- [ ] Automated suite passing (existing tests)

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] All HIGH-risk features tested
- [ ] No open P0/P1 defects
- [ ] Coverage matrix shows no unaccepted gaps
- [ ] Regression suite green

## Risks to the Plan
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Feature X not code-complete by Day 3 | Test Feature Y first, shift X to Week 2 |
| Staging environment unstable | Run E2E locally against dev server |
```

## Release Test Plan

A release test plan aggregates sprint test plans and adds release-specific concerns.

```markdown
# Release [version] Test Plan
**Release date:** [date]
**Release manager:** [name]
**QA lead:** [name]

## Release Contents
| Sprint | Features | Test Status |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Sprint N | [features] | Complete |
| Sprint N+1 | [features] | In Progress |

## Release-Specific Testing
| Activity | Owner | Schedule | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Full regression on release candidate | [name] | Day -3 | Planned |
| Cross-browser verification (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) | [name] | Day -2 | Planned |
| Performance benchmark vs. previous release | [name] | Day -2 | Planned |
| Security scan on release branch | CI | Day -1 | Planned |
| Smoke test on production after deploy | [name] | Day 0 | Planned |

## Go/No-Go Criteria
See `release-readiness` for the full checklist.

- [ ] All sprint exit criteria met
- [ ] No P0/P1 defects open
- [ ] Performance within 10% of previous release
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Rollback plan tested
```

## Feature Coverage Matrix

```markdown
# Coverage Matrix: [Feature Name]

| ID | Scenario | Priority | Test Type | Test Location | Status |
|----|----------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|

| S2 | Validation: required fields empty | P0 | Unit | src/feature/__tests__/validate.test.ts | Automated |
| S3 | Error: server returns 500 | P1 | E2E | e2e/tests/feature/errors.spec.ts | Automated |
| S4 | Edge: unicode in text fields | P2 | Manual | -- | Planned |
| S5 | Perf: page loads under 2s | P1 | Perf | perf/feature-load.js | Automated |
| S6 | A11y: keyboard navigation | P1 | Manual | -- | GAP |
```
